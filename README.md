# No reference image and point cloud quality

This repository contains tools for distorting images and point clouds and evaluating them using the NR-IQA methods in pyiqa and two state-of-the-art NR-PCQA methods (MM-PCQA and MS-PCQE). It requires some configuration to get working but the instructions in the various READMEs should hopefully contain all the necessary information.
